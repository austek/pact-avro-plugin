=== Building the plugin

To build the plugin, you need a working JVM environment (version 11+).

The build tool used is `SBT` and you can build the plugin by running `sbt universal:stage`. This will compile the plugin and
put the generated files in `modules/plugin/target/stage`. The contents of this directory
and this will need to be copied into the Pact plugin directory. See the installation instructions on {doc-url}.
