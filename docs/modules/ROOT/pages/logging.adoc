= Logging

The plugin uses https://logback.qos.ch[Logback] to log to

* standard output
* `log/plugin.log` file in in the plugin directory.

The default log level is set to `ERROR` level and can be changed by the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable that is passed into the plugin process (this should be set by the framework calling it).

The default file logging is set to roll daily or whenever the file size reaches 50MB. Logger will keep 30 days' worth of logging history
